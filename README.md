## Overview:
The "Uber Rides Data Analysis using Python" project leverages Python libraries like Pandas for data manipulation and Matplotlib or Seaborn for visualization. The dataset is explored through techniques like exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in ride distances and frequencies. The project delivers a comprehensive analysis, supported by visualizations, enabling stakeholders to make data-driven decisions for improved service and operational efficiency.

# Objectives:
- Analyze Uber Ride Data: Examine ride distance and frequency patterns using Python.
- Identify Key Metrics: Determine common ride distances, highlighting that most trips range between 0-20 miles.
- Visualize Data: Create clear and informative visualizations, such as histograms or bar charts, to represent ride distribution.
- Provide Actionable Insights: Help stakeholders understand user behavior to optimize operations and enhance services.
